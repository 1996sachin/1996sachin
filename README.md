# Hello, I'm Sachin üëã

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I‚Äôm a Network & System Engineer with a strong focus on network security, automation, and DevOps. Currently, I work as a Network Administrator at Ambition Guru Company, where I ensure reliable and secure infrastructure operations.

üöÄ Recently, I‚Äôve been expanding into DevOps engineering, successfully deploying projects using Docker, Jenkins, and GitHub Webhooks for both Node.js and Laravel applications. I‚Äôve also demonstrated my expertise by configuring an Asterisk server on Ubuntu for local calling.

üí° My interests lie in Python scripting, Networking, Cybersecurity, and Cloud/DevOps practices, where I enjoy solving complex problems and building scalable solutions.
